# Comparative-Analysis-of-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
Compared machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN) for diabetic retinopathy detection using the Debrecen dataset. Preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning were applied. SVM achieved highest accuracy, but other models showed competitive performance.
